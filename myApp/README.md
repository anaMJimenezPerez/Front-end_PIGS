## Github Utils in Visual Studio Code

`git add .` This command adds all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories to the staging area. The dot (.) represents the current directory. It stages all modified and new files, but not deleted files.

`git commit -m "App profile"` This command creates a commit with the changes that have been staged. The `-m` flag allows you to add a commit message inline. In this case, "App profile" is the commit message, which ideally should succinctly describe the changes made in this commit.

`git pull origin Branch` This command fetches changes from a remote repository (usually named "origin") and merges them into the current branch. The Branch should be replaced with the name of the branch from which you want to pull changes. This command essentially synchronizes your local repository with the remote repository.

`git push origin Branch` This command pushes the commits from your local branch to the remote repository. Again, origin is typically the name given to the remote repository, and Branch should be replaced with the name of the branch you want to push your changes to.
